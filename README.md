## Description and technologies used

This GitHub repository contains an Authentication App implemented using the following technologies:

- Container: Docker
- Workspace: Nx
- Frontend: Angular v16
- Backend: Express
- Database: Mongoose
- Tests: Jasmine
- Styling: Ng Bootstrap
- Security: JWT Token (Frontend) and environment files for production (Backend)

To ensure security and authentication, the JWT Token is required in each API request if the user wants to POST any information. To access the MongoDB Atlas server, developers need to edit their own process.env file and insert the necessary credentials. This will enable them to connect to their Mongoose DB for development purposes. In addition to that, the developer will need to create a collection called 'login-collection' in MongoDB. Within this collection, they must include the 'username' and 'password' objects. This will allow Express, along with Mongoose, to retrieve the authentication information.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this repository for future enhancements and features.

## Understand this workspace

1. Build the app by executing the command `docker build -t auth-app`. This command will create a Docker image for the Authentication App.

2. Once the image is built, run the app using `docker-compose up`. This command will start the Nx workspace, allowing the Frontend and Backend apps to run seamlessly. Additionally, the Docker container will establish the necessary connections with the Database, ensuring smooth interaction between the components of the app.

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Description and technologies used

This is an Authentication App, coded with the following technologies:

- Container: Docker
- Workspace: Nx
- Frontend: Angular v16
- Backend: Express
- Database: Mongoose
- Tests: Jasmine
- Styling: Ng Boostrap
- Security: JWT Token (FE) && environment files for production (BE)

For future developments, in case the user wants to POST any information, the JWT Token will be required in each API request. In order for the dev to access his mongoose DB, it's required to edit his own process.env file and insert the needed credentials for the MongoDB atlas server.

`If the user tries to login with the wrong credentials, the app will return an error and won't allow the user to login`

## Understand this workspace

In order to containerize the app with Docker, first build the app with the `docker build -t auth .` command.

After run the `docker-compose up` so Docker can run the Nx workspace and, therefore, start the Frontend and Backend apps (connected with the Database.)

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
